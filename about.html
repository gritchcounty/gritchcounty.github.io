                <h3 class="centertext">ABOUT GRITCH COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY</h3>
                <p>Gritch County Water Authority (GCWA) was established in 1988 with approval from the Minnesota Pollution 
                    Control Agency (MPCA) to manage the Power Creek Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) and the Taupe 
                    Towers Lane Water Treatment Plant (WTP).</p>
                <p>For over 35 years, GCWA has served the community of Kent, as well as the Mitchell, Deerhorn, Atherton, 
                    Manston, Wolverton, Roberts, McCauleyville, Nordick, and Meadows townships.</p>
                <P>GCWA provides clean drinking water and treats wastewater at an exceptional rate, and has received a 
                    Diamond certification from the Minnesota Rural Water Association for 12 years in a row, meaning that
                    neither the Power Creek WPCP nor the Taupe Towers Lane WTP has violated its permit limits at either  
                    in that time period.</p>
                <p>GCWA also provides up-to-date training opportunities for its employees, and has committed to a two-year
                    program for all new operators to reach Class 2, and all plant employees to reach Class 3. Lab training
                    is also mandatory for operators at both the Power Creek wastewater treatment plant and at the drinking water treatment
                    plant. GCWA sends representatives to conferences every year for additional training.</p>
                <h3 class="centertext">2008 â€” KENT POISONING INCIDENT</h3>
                <p>In 2008, GCWA experienced a series of plant failures at the Taupe Towers Lane WTP due to extremely high ammonia 
                    and potassium in drinking water. Following this, GCWA failed to properly report the incidents to the public.
                    As a result, forty-seven (47) people died, one hundred and twenty-six (126) people were 
                    hospitalized, and four (4) children were born with serious health defects.</p>
                <p>In 2011, a class action lawsuit was started against the GCWA and an industrial 
                    user, Mhunck Chemical. In the ruling the U.S. Court of Appeals Eighth Circuit required GCWA and Mhunck Chemical 
                    to begin outreach efforts to minimize agricultural runoff and nutrient overload in its facilities as well 
                    as pay damages to the families of the survivors for the harm caused by the failure to treat the drinking 
                    water. GCWA and Mhunck Chemical worked tirelessly in the aftermath of the incident.
                    GCWA's ongoing non-violation status at both plants speaks for itself.</p>
                <p>Mhunck Chemical restructured as Mhunck Digital and continues to work closely with GCWA as required by the conditions of the Eighth Circuit 
                    ruling to ensure that similar incidents never occur again. Additional information and documents
                    can be found under the Archive tab.
