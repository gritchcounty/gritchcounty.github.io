                (hip, wrist, knuckles), and they will not fade or heal with treatment." Ad continues to discuss
                lesions and avoidance strategies. The solution is to purchase Heal-em-Ups by Capiary and have

            <p>This poster was created by Capiary in collaboration with GCWA and other industry leaders, most of
                which still work closely with GCWA. In lieu of payment Capiary offered deeply discounted Heal-em-Ups
                insertions for employees of the collaborating companies. Due to conflicts of interest GCWA was 
                unable to participate in the barter.

            <p>
                In the years after the ad campaign, Heal-em-Ups were discontinued. They are now considered 
                valuable collectors' items.
