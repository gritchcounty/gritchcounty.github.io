            <p>This poster was created by Dr. Mosterley &amp; Sons in collaboration with GCWA. By using water 
                sourced from the Taupe Towers Lane WTP, the brand hoped to associate its product in the minds
                of its consumers with cleanliness and health. DM&S cancelled this ad run in the aftermath
                of the Kent poisoning incident. <br>There has been no interest in resuming the campaign.
