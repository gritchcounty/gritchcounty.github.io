                Paste and an orange stick labeled Dr. Mosterley & Sons Milk Pencil. Text above reads:
                "We've been there too. It's the holiday season. You're home with your family. You've eaten
                your fill, and now you're sitting on the couch, catching up with everyone. But you can't shake
                the feeling that it'd be even better if you felt like you'd just drank a gallon of milk."</span>

            <p>This poster was created by Dr. Mosterley & Sons in collaboration with GCWA. By using water 
                sourced from the Taupe Towers Lane WTP, the brand hoped to associate its product in the minds
                of its consumers with cleanliness and health. DM&S cancelled this ad run in the aftermath
                of the Kent poisoning incident. <br>There has been no interest in resuming the campaign.
