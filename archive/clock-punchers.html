            <p>This poster was created by Clock-Punchers in collaboration with GCWA. The ad campaign ran
                until Clock-Punchers was absorbed by Tansopi Grand, Ltd. The
                clock-punchers URL was taken down on December 28, 2008—unfortunately between 11/3 and 12/28 
                eight potential clients signed up for the service, and GCWA was forced to issue refunds and an
                apology for the inconvenience.

                During the duration of the campaign GCWA rented out a cumulative 10,422 hours of manpower to 
                local businesses. In the aftermath of the Kent poisoning incident, critics pointed to this 
                program as a microcosm of the pattern of misappropriated resources within GCWA.
